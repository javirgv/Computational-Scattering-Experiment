# Chaotic Particle Scattering Simulation

*Fourth-year undergraduate Physics laboratory project (University College Dublin)*

## Overview
This project explores the trajectories of particles under complex force fields, including repulsive, attractive, and asymmetrical potentials. The goal was to implement numerical methods to accurately model particle motion and study how initial conditions affect scattering behavior.

## What I did
- Developed Python code to solve the equations of motion using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) method.  
- Simulated particle trajectories across a range of energies and impact parameters.  
- Visualized trajectories in 2D and 3D, overlaying paths on potential field plots.  
- Calculated transit times and scattering angles from simulation results.  
- Analyzed energy conservation to assess numerical accuracy and stability.  
- Prepared a reproducible notebook, structuring code for modularity and clarity.

## Technical focus
- **Programming & Tools:** Python, NumPy
- **Visualisation:** Matplotlib, 2D & 3D plotting 
- **Scientific Methods:** numerical integration methods, energy monitoring, stability and chaotic dynamics analysis  
- **Data Handling:** Structured input/output for reproducibility, multidimensional visualisation, contour and colormaps 
- **Modelling:** numerical implementation of fourth-order Runge-Kutta method for particle motion
- **Workflow:** reproducible analysis using Jupyter notebook and version control with Git

## Repository structure
- `notebook.ipynb` – Python Jupyter notebook containing all code for simulations, analysis, and plotting  
- `figures/` – generated plots illustrating trajectories, potentials, and energy evolution  
- `report.pdf` – Final PDF laboratory report
- `README.md` – Project overview and documentation 

## Notes
This repository serves as a portfolio example, demonstrating reproducible, well-documented computational workflows suitable for physical simulations, numerical modeling, and scientific computing applications rather than the theoretical derivation behind the experiment.

All numerical simulation and data analysis code used in the report PDF is available in the accompanying `.ipynb` Python Notebook.  
Report submitted as part of assessed coursework.
